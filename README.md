# CS-3310-Term-Project
Term Project for CS 3310 Programming Languages (Fall Semester 2023)

#### By Brynne Wright, Hunter Lane, and Arturo Perianez

## Part 1 - Algorithm Pseudocode 
Write an algorithm (pseudocode) to do the following conversions. 
The system should take in as input a number from one number system and convert it to another number system. 
The converted number should be displayed as output. The pseudocode you write should be in format that is easy to read and understand.
1. Decimal to Binary
2. Binary to Decimal
3. Decimal to Hexadecimal
4. Hexadecimal to Decimal
5. Hexadecimal to Binary
6. Binary to Hexadecimal

## Part 2 - Language Implementations
Choose any three different programming languages discussed in our 
textbook to implement the above algorithm. 
You can score a BONUS of 50 points if any two of the three programming 
languages come from atleast two different language categories such as: 
imperative, functional, and logic. 
File to upload: implementation files with the correct extensions

## Part 3 - Language Evaluation Criteria
Use the language evaluation criteria listed in our textbook under Chapter 1 
Section 1.3 Language Evaluation Criteria to evaluate the three 
programming languages with respect to solving the above mentioned 
problem. Tabulate your results and write a brief description explaining your 
findings.

## Part 4 - Reflection
Overall, discuss your experience implementing the same problem in three 
different programming languages, influences of language design, and 
discuss how this experience has i) Increased capacity to express ideas (ii) 
Increased ability to learn new languages, (iii) Better understanding of the 
significance of implementation, (iv) Better use of languages that are 
already known, and (v) Improved background for choosing appropriate 
languages
